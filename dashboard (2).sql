The two Marathi films, Kasav and Ventilator stood out for their fine content. Ventilator takes a wry look at human behaviour at the critical juncture when death beckons. And Sumitra Bhave\'s Kasav is a lyrical journey of two bruised souls whose paths cross briefly to stir them from descending further into the dark abyss of self-pity. Village Rockstars (Assamese) dealt with the abject rural poor with profound humanism. The story of a tomboy\'s aspiration to be a rock star in a remote village is told with moving honesty. Though Macher Jhol (Bangla) reminded me of A Hundred Foot Journey, it grew from a novel idea. How mother\'s cooking, that has stood for the ultimate culinary benchmark, makes it social impact at a critical moment. No film dealt with this commonly/ fondly held belief until now. The six Hindi features shortlisted on their merit for exploring the social reality were original  in  content. Their sensitive, non-formula treatment  dictated my choice. It is  apparent these  films were  made from the maker\'s deep convictions. And, mercifully, they   lacked superficial loss, social  pretensions  and star power .   It\'s worth pointing out that the best quality of the films was their organic growth and  clarity of  vision. NEWTON  for example,   many thought was a minor work. Yet it   managed to disturb me about corrupt political machinery and untold  frustrations of honest election officers  who take grave risks. This behind the scene reality is rarely seen on screen .  Sheer breadth of contents , new emerging styles, and the maker\'s admirable passion  raised  my  hopes for the independent cinema  of India .

The reason these campaigns make the list of 2017, is because not only have\r\n							they all been successful in their respective missions, but the fact that each of them in their own way, have managed to\r\n							bring out a positive change either by invoking humane values, spreading awareness, or by mobilising huge crowds worldwide\r\n							for social causes.\r\n						</p>\r\n						<footer>Hussain Kalvert</footer>\r\n					</blockquote>\r\n				<br><br>\r\n				\r\n				<blockquote class="blockquote">\r\n  <p class="text-uppercase h2"><span>1.</span>#Isitokforguys... | AXE  </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>#isitokforguys kicks off the AXE mission to expose the pressure guys feel to \'be a man\' and empower them to be whoever they damn well want. <br>\r\n \r\n<br>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="video-container"><iframe  height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0WySfa7x5q0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n</div><br/>\r\n				<blockquote class="blockquote">\r\n  <p class="text-uppercase h2"><span>2.</span> #KnowYourLemons </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p> While a lump is the most common sign of breast cancer, some symptoms can be seen rather than felt.

However, theatre can and does take up causes, because most of them-- at least in urban areas-- know that they are reaching out to an audience that is open to ideas. Often, it means they are preaching to the converted, but some issues like gender inequality, aging, violence and alternative sexuality can never be focussed on or discussed enough. Which is why a play like&nbsp;The Vagina Monologues&nbsp;(female empowerment) is running successfully for years and on a smaller scale&nbsp;Ek Madhavbaug&nbsp;(on a mother\'s understanding of her son\'s homosexuality) is performed regularly;&nbsp;Sandhya Chhaya&nbsp;and&nbsp;Kaalchakra&nbsp;(on aging),&nbsp;Jis Lahore Nahin Dekhya&nbsp;(on communalism) have lasted for a long time.\r\n\r\nSome of the plays (like&nbsp;Last Over) have wisely used humour in tackling dark issues, and some (like&nbsp;The Father) have gone straight for the heart. A Marathi play (Var Khali Don Pay) keeps the rape debate alive, while a Gujarati play (Saat Teri Ekvees) looks at women\'s sexuality in the Tinder generation.

Weinstein\'s conviction was a stand-alone event, but it generated large ripples- it gave women the world over the courage to speak out and share their stories, and in doing so, to take control of their lives. \r\n</p>\r\n<br/>\r\n<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html"> https://www.nytimes.com</a><br/>\r\n<br/><img class="img-responsive" src="images/Sustainable%20development/YEARENDER2017%20_0002_Harvey-Weinstein-Paid-Off-Sexual-Harassment-Accusers-for-Decades.jpg"/> <br/>\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote class="blockquote">\r\n<p class="text-uppercase h2">3.

There will be very few properties that will deliver instant Return On Investment, now and henceforth. With viewership the way it is fragmented, content will have to endure for it to breakeven and then profit, which means, storytelling has to be at the center of all decision making henceforth.The industry is now compelled to recalibrate itself across all its vertical and horizontal matrices, and the one and only thing that will remain consistent but ironically also the most underrated, is storytelling. Everyone is in search for a good story, one that will engage audiences and captivate them; but is there a formula that will lead them to it and are there any indicators which will guide them towards the right story and promise to work? Yes there are, but in my objective understanding of things, the academicians who deliver research on the subject of how entertainment shapes our thinking and changes the way we are and how it impacts our attitudes and behaviors towards contemporary ideas and concepts, are neither as seamlessly integrated to the present system which works and which is defined by thought leaders who influence storytelling; and nor are they convincing enough for stakeholders who lead as well as govern the industry of media and entertainment. On one end academia is brimming with interesting ideas and compositions which are applicable to the command and at the other end, decision makers are also totally open to the creative engineering, but it is the revenue driven models based on precedential market research and consumer behavior studies, that have become a frightfully dominant construct on basis which the entire business functions; which is the barrier to progress.At the Asian Centre for Entertainment Education (ACEE), where we also host our flagship program The Third Eye which is a Creative Alliance for Global Health and Sustainability partnership with Hollywood Health and Society (HH&amp;S), Norman Lear Centre, University of Southern California Annenberg and which is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), it was an eventful year as we tracked some of the changes that are taking place, provided support to content creators by sharing our learning&rsquo;s on the various platforms that we have built over the years to engage with them, and as we explored storytelling in the several contemporary and emerging forms that India&rsquo;s consumers are beginning to accept them in. The model we have adapted to context in India over the last five years, is borrowed from our partners HH&amp;S which has now worked with the business of entertainment in the USA for almost twenty years. We reach out to creative communities through the worldwide web where we host our online resource center for creative and development communities (www.acee-thethirdeye.net) and our news portal The Daily Eye (www.thedailyeye.info) where our editorial team showcases stories and events which are mostly ignored by the cacophonous primetime and mainstream news media, and which are inspiring and relevant to content creators who love to explore evolving cultures and art; and through social media. We also reach out to the two communities through our weekly newsletters, which are sent out to a large database of producers, directors, writers, creative leaders, specialists, experts, social scientists and development agencies. We connect to our core target audience and align with them strategically through specially organized meetings, briefings and events in which we share insights and learning&rsquo;s that are gathered during travel across the country to study the shifts taking place in peoples attitudes and behaviors towards issues related to gender, water and sanitation, health, environment and sustainable development and to observe the way in which audiences respond to the many forms of entertainment that are available to them. A study funded and guided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to observe the shift in social norms towards issues surrounding reproductive health, like preference for sons, child marriage and birth spacing; for which The Third Eye program has forged partnerships with MICA School of Ideas, Ahmedabad, Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) and Ormax Media as well as with a host of television producers, writers, networks and content creators, is underway as we step into this new year. The layout of interventions for the study in mainstream and popular entertainment to ascertain the impact of storytelling on diverse socio-economic groups and cultures vis-&agrave;-vis the issues of concern, is massive. The report that will be generated with inputs from all the partners will give exponential privilege to content creators at large, to provide the indicators required to determine the way forward for storytellers. The impressions of over 80 gender experts from the fields of Media, Culture and Gender Studies and from across four Indian cities in the Hindi Speaking Markets of India who were met with, have been incorporated to the research design, which is being implemented as we publish this piece. The Third Eye program&rsquo;s partnership with the Girl Effect (GE) program further augmented the team&rsquo;s learning&rsquo;s in 2017. ACEE carried out two rounds of the most contemporary Media Landscape Analysis&rsquo;, and organized several immersions for the GE team, which was led by Mark Sanderson, Brand Director India, GE, who is in the process of finalizing an entertainment property; and aiming to understand the latest discourse on issues related to Gender in India.But the most intense learning&rsquo;s in 2017 came from a pilot for a project envisioned by the former CEO of Children&rsquo;s Film Society of India (CFSI) and present Joint Secretary Ministry of Culture and Vice Chancellor of the famous Nav Nalanda University in Bihar. Phase 1 of the Little Directors project of Dr. Shravan Kumar, took us to the State of Bihar, where young filmmakers trained by ACEE, mentored adolescents in faraway media dark areas, to make short films in which they could express their aspirations, hopes, fears and anxieties regarding issues related to Drinking Water and Sanitation and at the intersection of Gender. This pilot was implemented under the Swacch Action Plan (SAP), which has been formulated in collaboration between the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Government of India.ACEE designed an Impact Evaluation in concert with the World Banks Research team and Development Impact Evaluation Program (DIME) where the participants, who wrote stories, produced, directed and photographed the films themselves, as well as the communities that they belonged to, were observed to mark the shift in their attitudes and behaviors towards the issues. Phase 2 of the pilot program will be implemented in the State of Rajasthan in early 2018, but I leave you here with the films, which are unbelievably rich in style, form and storytelling and made by young girls and boys of Patna, Beguserai, Lakhiserai and Nawada in Bihar.</p><footer>Vinta Nanda </footer></blockquote><div class="color"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="text-uppercase h2">1. </p></blockquote><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqEY1QeO6-4"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/writerimg/JUDGE/KACHARAPUR1.jpg"/></a> <br/><br/><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="text-uppercase h2">2. </p></blockquote><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0h2EkCOZO4"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/writerimg/JUDGE/BACHPAn1.jpg"/></a><br/><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="text-uppercase h2">3. </p></blockquote><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l76GMVJ7ZcE"><im', 'abhi.jpg', '2017', 'a'),
